# In this python script you will read in 2 ciphertext files and one
# known plaintext file.  The ciphertext files have been generated using 
# two different plaintext files but the same key and the same nonce.
#
# By XORing the two ciphertext files, you will get the same result as 
# just XORing the two plaintext files.
#
# By XORing the resulting XOR of the two plaintext files with the known plaintext 
# (plaintext1),you will recover the original plaintext2.
#
# SYNTAX:

# python3 part03_xor_nonce_reuse.py <cipherTextFile1> <cipherTextFile2> <knownPlainTextFile> <recoveredPlainTextFile>
